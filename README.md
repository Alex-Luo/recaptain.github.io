# Recaptain Landing page
Landing page for Recaptain, the slackbot.

It is a bot built for Slack, that is used to summarisze the chat log in a public channel in the team.
A user would insert their API token in the form on the website and the bot will automaticly run in their teams channel.

This is not the actual landing page. It is not actually hooked up to the bot yet, this is only the front end design.
